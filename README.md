# FEND "Nanodegree Animal Trading Card" Project
"Animal Trading Cards" project for the FEND Google Developer Nanodegree 

The code has been reviewed to respect the project's guidelines. In addition, the following tweaks were added:
- green color palette for the card's elements
- differentiation between "IDs" for single items, and "classes" for repeated items
- on-hover shadow effects on: the whole card; the title; the picture; the info-box
- different types of borders for the elements of the card
 except i modified the code and now it's terrible stuff in italian sorry <3
